# bachelor_thesis_repo

This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis

To use the code, download the multi2WOZ Dataset and create a folder "multi2woz_dataset" where you need to put the files.

Then you will be able to execute the model_training.ipynb

The adapters folder contains the trained adapters created in this project (There is a section how to use them in the model_training.ipynb)
